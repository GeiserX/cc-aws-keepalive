# cc-aws-keepalive

Keep Claude Code sessions alive through AWS credential expiration: four small Node.js command-line scripts, wired into Claude Code's credential, hook and status line settings, warn you before your SSO or SAML session runs out, read fresh credentials from `~/.aws/credentials`, and can log you back in on their own.

On AWS Bedrock, Claude Code used to keep expired credentials in memory, and a session hung until you restarted the tab ([issue 41064](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/41064), closed as stale in May 2026). Since v2.1.207, [Claude Code's Bedrock docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/amazon-bedrock#credential-caching-and-resolution-timeout) say it drops its cached credentials after a credential error and resolves them again. cc-aws-keepalive adds what Claude Code doesn't do: a warning before the session expires, a countdown, an automatic re-login, and an `awsAuthRefresh` that notices you already logged in from another terminal.

## Features

- `aws-cred-export.mjs` reads fresh credentials from `~/.aws/credentials`, bypassing the SDK cache (`awsCredentialExport`).
- `aws-auth-refresh.mjs` recovers from a Bedrock 403, noticing if you already re-authenticated in another terminal (`awsAuthRefresh`).
- `aws-cred-check.mjs` warns before each prompt when credentials are expired or close to expiry (`hooks.UserPromptSubmit`).
- `aws-statusline.mjs` shows an optional countdown in the status bar, e.g. `AWS: 4h23m` (`statusLine`).
- Optional automatic re-login through your own `autoLoginCmd`, with keychain passwords and push MFA.
- Optional credential sync to other machines over SSH, an HTTPS webhook or a command.
- Works with saml2aws, gimme-aws-creds, aws-google-auth and any tool that writes to `~/.aws/credentials`.
- macOS, Linux and Windows.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GeiserX/cc-aws-keepalive.git
cd cc-aws-keepalive
node install.mjs
```

Needs Node 18 or newer and a `~/.aws/credentials` file. The installer creates a config and prints the settings to add to `~/.claude/settings.json`; to install it as a Claude Code plugin instead, see [Getting started](docs/getting-started.md).
